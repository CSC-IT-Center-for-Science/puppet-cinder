    Fixes `bug 1753596
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1753596>`__ so the backend_host
    option is set in each cinder-volume backend driver's section, and not in
    the DEFAULT section where the option isn't relevant.

    A previous deprecation notice stated the host option was deprecated in
    favor of the backend_host option. This was misleading because the note
    failed to clarify this only applied to options in the cinder-volume
    backend driver sections. In the DEFAULT section, the host option is not
    deprecated, and the backend_host option isn't relevant.
